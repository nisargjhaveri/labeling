# labeling
An diagram labeling app

## How to setup
- Clone the repository
- run `npm install`, it should install dependencies.
- Make sure that you have Node.js v0.8. Otherwise somehow get it. (maybe use `nvm` or getting the binary for your OS and putting it in `./bin`.)

## How to run
- Once installed, just run it by `node --harmony app.js`.
- Replace `node` by the correct binary. (If you have binary in `./bin`, run `./bin/node --harmony app.js`)

**See http://appjs.com/ and https://github.com/appjs/appjs to troubleshoot installation and startup.**
