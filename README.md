# labeling
An diagram labeling app. To help school students and teachers to deliver and gain knowledge in better, newer way!

I wrote it years ago. It was my first attempt with `Node.js` and `appjs`. So, the code might not be nice enough.

## Features
- Add new diagram.
- Edit diagrams.
- Learn, Practice and Test modes.
- Multiple language support, currently English and Gujarati.

## How to setup
- Clone the repository.
- run `npm install`, it should install dependencies.
- Make sure that you have Node.js v0.8. Otherwise somehow get it. (maybe use `nvm` or getting the binary for your OS and putting it in `./bin`.)

## How to run
- Once installed, just run it by `node --harmony app.js`.
- Replace `node` by the correct binary. (If you have binary in `./bin`, run `./bin/node --harmony app.js`)

**See http://appjs.com/ and https://github.com/appjs/appjs to troubleshoot installation and startup.**
